						<th><p>Hello, first I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my biography. 
							My name is Darren Greaux, I am a Computer Science graduate from Middlesex County College. 
							I was born and raised in Edison, New Jersey, and attended Edison High School where I achieved the technolology department award. 
							I have three older sisters, as well as a dog and a cat. I find great interest in computers and their capabilities. 
							Some other interests of mine include cars, woodworking, video games, movies, and coffee. One fun fact that not many people know about me is that I am an ordained minister, and officiated my sisters wedding. 
							Since graduating Middlesex College I would like to find a career in software development where I can continue to grow my knowledge and understanding of computers and contribute to spectacular things. 
							The concept of the limitless possibilities that computers can achieve has always fascinated me and I enjoy learning and understanding how computers work and the potential they carry.</p></th>
